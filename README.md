# Counter
A counter that displays the on-screen button clicks

Purpose for build:

This project gave me familiarity with buttons and creating event listeners for those buttons.

Features:

Counter begins at 0. When the value is a positive number, the color changes from black to Green. As the counter decreases and becomes a negative number, the color changes to red. 

A reset button has also been added to take the count back to 0. This turns the color back to black.

Suggestions for improvements are always welconme :)
